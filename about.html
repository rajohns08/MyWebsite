			I am a recent Computer Engineering graduate of Mississippi State University (MSU) currently seeking software engineering employment. It was through my coursework at MSU that I discovered my passion for software engineering. The idea of being able to solve complex problems through writing code is very appealing to me. I especially enjoy interface design to simplify user experiences and interactions with whatever technology they may be using.
